The following is a list of material designed to support those wishing to influence others in the change process. No matter what your day job or official role is, the ability to communicate effectively is vital. Working through some of the material will build your confidence as a Practitioner, especially the material in Essentials. Completing the most of the material will put you on the path towards Expert.

  

## 1. Essentials

  

### Communities to join (suggestion - join 2)

  

There are many communities which are worth joining within the government and public sector which can increase your knowledge and expand your network.

  

#### Digital sustainability

  

- International group of tech workers, organising events and publishers of Branch magazine. Active Slack community. [https://climateaction.tech/](https://climateaction.tech/)

  

#### Government environmental and climate

  

-  **GOV News**. cross-government informal community space for the UK public sector. [https://community.gov.news](https://community.gov.news)

  

-  **X-GOV Slack**. Digital space for civil servants to share and collaborate across government. There are several channels devoted to sustainability. [https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com)

  

-  **Monthly X-gov climate show and tells**. As the name suggests, this group meets monthly to share work being done across the public sector and wider. The format is 5 minutes to present, 5 minutes Q&A. See [http://bit.ly/govclimateinfo](http://bit.ly/govclimateinfo) and [http://bit.ly/climatespeak](http://bit.ly/climatespeak)

## Activities (suggestion - try 1)

  

-  **Community 10,000**. DWP-supported volunteering initiative. If you are not in DWP, then ask, your department or employer may offer something similar. Volunteering on nature-based activities is a great way to reconnect and engage with other like-minded people. [https://dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/2020/03/13/digging-wheelbarrows-and-picks-dwp-digital-volunteers-in-the-community/](https://dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/2020/03/13/digging-wheelbarrows-and-picks-dwp-digital-volunteers-in-the-community/)

  

-  **Climate Fresk**. Climate Fresk originated in France, but is now a global phenomenon. It's a low-cost 3-hour workshop (in person or virtual) in which attendees collaborate to understand the interconnection of human activity and climate change. The word 'fresk' is short for 'fresco', as the workshop uses a visual collage to bring together the ideas. Once you have attended a Climate Fresk, there is the opportunity to take a short training course to become a facilitator. Find a Climate Fresk local to you at [https://climatefresk.org/world/](https://climatefresk.org/world/)

  

-  **Digital Collage**. Similar to the Climate Fresk, but looking at the impact of digital activity. [https://digitalcollage.org/index.html](https://digitalcollage.org/index.html)

  

-  **Carbon Literacy**. According to their website, 'Learners who have completed a day’s worth of Carbon Literacy learning can be certified as ‘Carbon Literate’' There are options for both individuals and organisations. [https://carbonliteracy.com/individual/courses/](https://carbonliteracy.com/individual/courses/)

-

-  **Giki Zero**. There are quite a few online carbon calculators and apps, Giki has a free website and mobile app to help you calculate your own footprint, combined with education, nudges and challenges. Why not test it out on your own or with a few colleagues or friends? h[ttps://zero.giki.earth/](ttps://zero.giki.earth/)

  

### Videos (suggestion - watch 2)

  

-  **The Systems Iceberg Explained** - A systems thinking model that is useful when considering approaches to addressing issues such as sustainability and the environment. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6h2_EcOOcM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6h2_EcOOcM)

  

-  **What does it all mean: Net-zero, carbon neutral, climate positive, carbon negative? by Asim Hussain** - Good breakdown of some of the crucial terminology, focussed specifically on digital emissions. 20 minutes, broken into clear chapters. [https://youtu.be/HXEnbi64TdQ?si=Ff4eGg2uo4OUxsQm](https://youtu.be/HXEnbi64TdQ?si=Ff4eGg2uo4OUxsQm)

  

*  **BBC News: AI Decoded** Excellent report on the environmental impacts of AI with a panel of very knowledgable experts. Although it's about AI, it covers many other important areas of digital sustainability. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjNacsyp28s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjNacsyp28s)

  

*  **Clouded II: Does Cloud Cost the Earth?** - Feature-length documentary on the environmental impacts of cloud computing. Engrossing, even for non-techies. [https://www.clouded.tv/](https://www.clouded.tv/) (trailer at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPLMyY71_eM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPLMyY71_eM))

  

### Digital footprint tools (suggestion - try 1)

  

The following 2 tools help calculate your online footprint. Sadly there is no reliable UK-based calculator (yet), soo these european ones will have to do for now.

  

* https://myimpact.isit-europe.org/. Excellent tool for estimating the emissions from typical work and home digital activities. Unfortunately the calculator only has carbon intensity data for France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Belgium is the most similar to the UK for this (see https://app.electricitymaps.com to understand this further).

  

* https://impactco2.fr/usagenumerique/. Related to the previous site, but with some very good calculations for things like sending emails and use of network (4G vs. Wifi). It's in French and uses French emissions factors, which makes it less than ideal. But still an excellent tool and reference source. The French are certainly leading in this area.

  

## 2. Everything else

  

  

### Other websites to explore (suggestion - explore 2)

  

*  **Electricity Maps** - the leading tool for understanding carbon intensity. https://app.electricitymaps.com/map

  

*  **UK National Grid maps** - there are many sites and APIs offering this, here are some good ones. https://www.carbonintensity.org.uk/, https://www.energydashboard.co.uk/live and https://electricityproduction.uk/

  

*  **Branch Magazine** - online magazine for green digital enthusiasts. The website design responds to the carbon intensity of the UK grid, which is pretty cool. https://branch.climateaction.tech/

  

*  **Ecograder** - online tool (one of many) which creates a report on how well a web page performs from an environmental perspective. There are many similar tools out there, but Ecograder produces some of the clearest and most actionable reports. https://ecograder.com/

  

*  **Reslio IT hardware database** - amazing list of hardware and its environmental impact. https://db.resilio.tech/

  

*  **NASA Global Climate Change Interactives** - wide range of interactive visualisations related to climate and environment. https://climate.nasa.gov/explore/interactives/
