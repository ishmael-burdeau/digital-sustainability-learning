# Digital sustainability for technologists  
The following is a list of material designed to support those in technical roles to reach a level of Practitioner. Completing the optional material will put you on the path towards Expert level. 

## Essential training and resources 

### 1. Green software training 
These two courses are essential for understanding the basics of Green Software and should only take a couple of hours to complete. They are free and open to all.

- [ ]  **Sustainable software engineering overview**
Great into video series by Asim Hussain (Green Software Foundation). Very digestible, only takes about 30 minutes to complete. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/sustainable-software-engineering-overview/
- [ ]  **Green Software Practitioner**
Slightly more in-depth online course. Takes 2-3 hours to complete. Recommended. Take the short exam with the Linux Foundation to get certified. https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/ and https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/green-software-for-practitioners-lfc131/

### 2. Videos

- [ ] **Beth yw cynaliadwyedd digidol? / What is digital sustainability?** Panel discussion by the Centre for Digital Public Services in Wales. Covers all the main topics related to digital sustainability, especially from a UK government perspective. Panellists include Hannah Smith from the Green Web Foundation as well experts from Defra, Wholegrain Digital and the Centre for Sustainability. Despite the title, the content is all in English. The first 25 minutes are devoted to each panelist speaking for 5 minutes, followed by a wider discusson. It's generally a non-technical discusson, so suitable for all. 1 hour 12 minutes, but broken up into clear chapters.

- [ ]  **What does it all mean: Net-zero, carbon neutral, climate positive, carbon negative? by Asim Hussain** Good breakdown of some of the crucial terminology, focussed speficically on digital emissions. 20 minutes, broken into clear chapters.

* [ ] **BBC News: AI Decoded** Excellent report on the environmental impacts of AI with a panel of very knowledgable experts. Although it's about AI, it covers many other important areas of digital sustainability. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjNacsyp28s

## Optional training materials 
### 1. Online courses
#### E-learning 
These two courses are both very good and recommended if you have the time. 
- [ ] **Career Essentials in Sustainable Tech by Microsoft and LinkedIn.** About 3.5 hours. A good overall introduction to the topic of sustainability. Covers areas such as Net Zero, carbon accounting, the circular economy, LCAs, procurement as well as some light-touch information on why digital services must also transition to being sustainable. The digital part of the course makes some claims that could be questioned or challenged. Requires a LinkedIn account. 
https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/career-essentials-in-sustainable-tech-by-microsoft-and-linkedin
- [ ]  **Sustainable Software Engineering**
Fairly in-depth course with some Python coding examples. Takes 6-8 hours to complete, but the videos may be blocked for some as they are on Vimeo. Note that the graded coding exercises are not available in self-paced mode. The pace can be a little slow at times, but there are some very good arguments and examples made. Part 1 is focussed on the problem of digital emissions and higher-level thinking, while Part 2 is more focussed on technical approaches. Part 1 is strongly recommended for all, while Part 2 is a little weaker.
