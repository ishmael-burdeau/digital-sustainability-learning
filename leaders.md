# Digital sustainability for leaders   
The following is a list of material for those in a leadership position. Sustainability has become a leadership pillar, and understanding the problems of climate change and environmental degradation and your associated obligations as well as the potential opportunities offered by sustainability is vital as we move to 2030 and beyond.

For leaders, there are 3 key concepts related to digital sustainability. Keep these concepts in mind as you go through the learning material. 

1) **Reducing cost**. In digital, sustainable solutions are generally cheaper and more cost effective. This could mean making more effective use of resources, using less or making hardware last longer. 
2) **Meeting legal obligations**. There are a range of legal reporting obligations which organisations are expected to meet. These are expected to grow as we move closer to key 2050 milestones, such as 2030. 
3) **Staff retention and recruitment**. There is growing evidence that workers increasingly put an emphasis on an employer's values when thinking about their careers. Being an environmentally responsible employer is no longer an optional 'nice to have', but rather an essential part of your talent strategy. 

Go through the 'Executive Summary' to get started. Working through much of the essential material will build your confidence as a Practitioner. Completing some or all the all the optional material will put you on the path towards Expert.
