## Essentials

### 1. Self-evaluation tools
You are no doubt familiar with maturity matrices. They are a good way to evaluate the maturity of your team and organisation. The following two are focussed on digital sustainability, and familiarity with these is an excellent way  to measure and improve the sustainability of your team and the products you are building.  
- [ ] **Green Software Maturity Matrix**. Self-evaluation tool by the GSF to help organisations understand their level of maturity in this area. This is good, but also high level. A sample output from GreenGauge can be found below. https://maturity-matrix.greensoftware.foundation/

- [ ] **GreenGauge.** GreenGauge is an open source tool developed by Kainos to support https://github.com/KainosSoftwareLtd/GreenGauge/blob/main/docs/service-design-matrix.md

- [ ] **Assessment of my individual / professional digital environmental footprint in kg CO2 eq.** Excellent tool for estimating the emissions from typical work and home digital activities, could be scaled up to a team. Unfortunately the calculator only has carbon intensity data for France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Belgium is the most similar to the UK for this (see https://app.electricitymaps.com to understand this further). https://myimpact.isit-europe.org/

### 2. Guidelines
- [ ] **W3C Web Sustainability Guidelines, 1.0.** A new initiative, covers business, design and technology aspects of digital services. See https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/. Condensed version: https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/glance.html and quick reference: https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/quickref.html

- [ ] **GOV.UK Technology Code of Practice**. Point 12 outlines the GOV.UK position on sustainability in ICT. See https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-your-technology-sustainable 

- [ ] **Planet Centred Design**. A new proposal by Defra to support those designing and building digital services. See https://defradigital.blog.gov.uk/2023/03/06/how-being-planet-centric-can-really-make-a-difference-when-designing-services/ and https://drive.google.com/file/d/161GLM3MiuLmehr4zR6yfmFRV67ON4ml1/view 

 

### Videos

- [ ]  **What does it all mean: Net-zero, carbon neutral, climate positive, carbon negative? by Asim Hussain** - Good breakdown of some of the crucial terminology, focussed specifically on digital emissions. 20 minutes, broken into clear chapters. 
https://youtu.be/HXEnbi64TdQ?si=Ff4eGg2uo4OUxsQm 

* [ ] **BBC News: AI Decoded** Excellent report on the environmental impacts of AI with a panel of very knowledgable experts. Although it's about AI, it covers many other important areas of digital sustainability. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjNacsyp28s

* **Clouded II: Does Cloud Cost the Earth?** - Feature-length documentary on the environmental impacts of cloud computing. Engrossing, even for non-techies. https://www.clouded.tv/ (trailer at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPLMyY71_eM)
