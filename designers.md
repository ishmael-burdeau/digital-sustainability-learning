# Digital sustainability for designers  
The following is a list of material designed to support those in design roles to reach a level of Practitioner. Completing the optional material will put you on the path towards Expert level. 

## Essential training and resources 

### 1. Green software training 
These two courses are essential for understanding the basics of Green Software and should only take a couple of hours to complete. They are free and open to all.

- [ ]  **Sustainable software engineering overview**
Great into video series by Asim Hussain (Green Software Foundation). Very digestible, only takes about 30 minutes to complete. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/sustainable-software-engineering-overview/
- [ ]  **Green Software Practitioner**
Slightly more in-depth online course. Takes 2-3 hours to complete. Recommended. Take the short exam to get certified. https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/

### 2. Videos

- [ ] **Tom Greenwood: A sustainable web for everyone** Tom Greenwood was the lead author of the Sustainable Web Manifesto, edits the monthly green web newsletter, Curiously Green, and is author of the book, Sustainable Web Design. This 36 minute presentation by Tom is divided up into small, digestible chunks and covers all the key topics in a non-technical way. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebxeXqjesOo

- [ ] **Beth yw cynaliadwyedd digidol? / What is digital sustainability?** Panel discussion by the Centre for Digital Public Services in Wales. Covers all the main topics related to digital sustainability, especially from a UK government perspective. Panellists include Hannah Smith from the Green Web Foundation as well experts from Defra, Wholegrain Digital and the Centre for Sustainability. Despite the title, the content is all in English. The first 25 minutes are devoted to each panelist speaking for 5 minutes, followed by a wider discusson. It's generally a non-technical discusson, so suitable for all. 1 hour 12 minutes, but broken up into clear chapters.

## Websites to explore

### 1. Sustainable web design

A few examples of carbon-aware web design and guidance. 

* **Sustainable Web Design** - Includes and manifesto and some useful guidelines. https://sustainablewebdesign.org/

* **Branch Magazine** - online magazine for green digital enthusiasts. The website design responds to the carbon intensity of the UK grid, which is pretty cool. https://branch.climateaction.tech/

* **Fershad Irani** (personal site). Good example of a carbon-aware website. https://fershad.com/carbon-aware-site/

### 2. Carbon intensity tools
Understanding carbon intensity, or the 'cleanness' of your electricity is an important component of a less environmentally damaging Internet. These interactive, map-based sites bring an abstract concept to life. 
* **Electricity Maps:** emissions factors worldwide. https://app.electricitymaps.com/map, https://electricityproduction.uk/, https://www.energydashboard.co.uk/map 

* **UK National Grid maps** - there are many sites and APIs offering this, here are some good ones. https://www.carbonintensity.org.uk/, https://www.energydashboard.co.uk/live and https://electricityproduction.uk/ 


### 3. Web page analysis tools
Web-based tools to rate web pages in terms of sustainability. Only useful for analysis of the front end. 
* **Ecograder** - online tool (one of many) which creates a report on how well a web page performs from an environmental perspective. There are many similar tools out there, but Ecograder produces some of the clearest and most actionable reports.   https://ecograder.com/ 
* **Beacon** - Similar to Ecograder. https://digitalbeacon.co/
* **Globemallow** - Similar to Ecograder. https://globemallow.io/#api
